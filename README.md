# ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_ANALYSIS_SQL
SQL project analyzing worldwide energy consumption, production, GDP, and emissions using complex queries for real-world insights.

# üåç Energy Consumption Analysis (SQL Project)

This project focuses on analyzing worldwide **energy consumption, production, GDP, population, and emissions** using SQL. The dataset used is `ENERGYDB`, which contains structured data across multiple tables. The goal is to extract **actionable insights** and understand global energy patterns through advanced SQL queries.

## üìÇ Dataset Information
The database includes the following tables:
- **country** ‚Äì Country details
- **population** ‚Äì Population statistics
- **production** ‚Äì Energy production data
- **consumption** ‚Äì Energy consumption details
- **emission** ‚Äì CO‚ÇÇ and other emissions
- **gdp** ‚Äì GDP information
